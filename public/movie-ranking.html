<h3>1. Naruto</h3>

<p>This has around more than 700 episode, though I <br>would agree that it has quite a lot of fillers <br> but still this is an epic story and closest to my heart.</p>

<h3>2. Monster</h3>

<p>This is a very good anime, it has it's dark psychology <br>and murder mystery anime with great suspence.</p>

<h3>3. Attact on titan</h3>

<p>It is an action, supernatural power based anime with <br>a great story line, gets brutal sometimes though.</p>
